    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    
    <p>Please bring: a yoga or work-out mat, a blanket for if you get cold, a bottle of water and your curiosity ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>What to expect: We will have a 5-10 minute intro chat about the sounds that will be played and if there are certain sounds or sensations that you would like to emphasize. You will be laying in the center of four speakers where I will manipulate sounds meant to soothe , stimulate or guide you through a particular journey unique to you. The sound journey will last 30 minutes and when it is finished I will leave a couple of minutes of silence so that you can adjust your ears and body to the stillness in the room.</p>

<p>So far people have found the sessions to be very immersive and need time afterwards to come back to their normal state of being.
When you are ready to sit up and feel comfortable, we can talk about your experience an feedback.</p>

<p>At this phase of development I ask for a small contribution between 7-10 euros per session. I can take cash or paypal at lindred@protonmail.com.</p>

<p>Thank you for participating! Iâ€™m looking forward to our session.</p>
