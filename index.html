    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    
    <p>It is an immersive surround sound experience with delicate field recordings, synthesized textures, hypnotizing drones and sub-frequencies to massage your body and brain; it’s a Sound Spa 🧖🏻‍♀️🔊🍃.</p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>

    <p>You lay in the center of four speakers and one subwoofer, the optimum place for listening in a surround sound environment. The sounds and textures travel around you and can sound like they are either very close to your ears or criss-cross around your body in geometric patterns, giving you the feeling of being gently cocooned or floating without your body . You only need to lay back, close your eyes, and be open to going on a journey that is uniquely crafted to you.</p>

    <h3>What does it sound like? </h3>

    <p>One session can include real and imagined sounds ranging from light bubbly textures, flowing waters, field recordings of nature, long hypnotizing drones, and sub-frequencies that massage your ears and body. Some sounds are recorded acoustically and others are synthesized using digital devices such as a laptop or modular synthesizer. <br><br>Examples here:</p>
